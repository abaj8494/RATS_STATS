# NoneType objects in game.points - caused by closing early? - protected against in reading games

## plans
resuming saved game -> confirm input screen should have button -> popup -> select game to load- > continue

DISPLAY STATS AT POINT END

FIX GRAPHICS
- whole UI needs a restrcture - can lean more on the kv file?
- can definitely have superclasses of screens to bring consistency
- can build out screens to be sublcasses of a screeen with whatever shit i want to go scross all of them

Super long term
- have one device viewing stats and one taking stats simultaneously
- location taking

# BUSINESS
- look at restructuring output into a relational database. Not sure about SQL, want open source.

# PLACEHOLDERS
- divisions, numbers

TODO LIST:

TO MAKE TAKING STATS EASIER:
- same line / set lines
- player numbers
- resuming saved game

STUFF TO BUILD:
- the magic number
- Expected Goals per Point (offence and defence)
- Some kind of catchall player valuation metric
- combination regressions

- email Mike Palmer about livestream integration
- take stats on Chilly game (fix player selection screen; Rob; make drops work)
- make rewind function (not necessary until the next live taking)

SOCIAL MEDIA
- long term: build own website with good integration to our stuff
- set up Google Account
- need to decide on a name: The People's Statisticians, East Coast Bias, The Resident Statisticians;
    The Rodent Statisticians
- analysis posted in Google Sheets, any commentary in Google Docs
- short term - set up Twitter/FB. Looking to get amongst Women's College Ulti, be explicit about our feminist utopia

REDO WORKFLOW
- have git - need to work on csv storage + sql database
